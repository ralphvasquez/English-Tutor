      "\n",
      "3. Break it down: Break the trick into smaller steps and teach them one at a time. For example, if you're teaching your dog to roll over, start with getting them to lie down first.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Be patient and consistent: Dogs learn at their own pace, so be patient and consistent with your training sessions. Practice regularly and keep sessions short and focused.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, every dog is unique, so adjust your training methods to suit your dog's personality and learning style. Good luck with teaching tricks to your Chihuahua! Let me know if you have any more questions.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. Active and Energetic: Poodles are active and energetic dogs that require regular exercise and mental stimulation to keep them happy and healthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Hypoallergenic Coat: Poodles have a curly, dense, and hypoallergenic coat, which means they shed less and are often a good choice for people with allergies.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Versatile: Poodles are versatile dogs and excel in various activities such as agility, obedience, and even as therapy dogs. They are known for their versatility and adaptability.\n",
